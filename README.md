This project focuses on the development and comparison of Artificial Intelligence agents (Heuristic, XGBoost, DQN). 
The underlying game environment is based on the open-source implementation of Space Invaders by [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/space-invaders).
The game engine has been modified to expose state variables for ML training and to allow external control by AI agents.
